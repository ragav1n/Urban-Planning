"high urban density requiring intensive infrastructure planning" : "moderate density suitable for balanced development"}. The zone demonstrates ${isLargeZone ? "complex administrative coordination needs" : "manageable governance structure"} with ${hasLargeWards ? "significant expansion potential" : "focused development opportunities"}.`,

    zone_viability: `Zone viability is ${averageDensity > 25000 ? "challenging due to overcrowding" : averageDensity > 15000 ? "good with proper infrastructure support" : "excellent with room for growth"}. The ${wardCount} wards provide ${isLargeZone ? "diverse development options but require coordinated planning" : "focused development potential with streamlined implementation"}. Population density of ${averageDensity}/km² ${averageDensity > 20000 ? "demands immediate infrastructure upgrades" : "supports sustainable development patterns"}.`,

    population_analysis: `The zone's ${totalPopulation.toLocaleString()} residents are distributed across ${wardCount} wards with an average of ${Math.round(totalPopulation / wardCount).toLocaleString()} people per ward. Population density of ${averageDensity}/km² ${isHighDensity ?

"High-population wards need priority attention for service delivery." : "Population distribution allows for equitable resource allocation."}`,

    infrastructure_implications: `Infrastructure requirements are ${isHighDensity ? "substantial" : "moderate"} given the ${averageDensity}/km² density. Priority needs include ${isHighDensity ? "mass transit systems, multi-level parking, advanced waste management, and high-capacity utilities" : "improved road networks, reliable utilities, community facilities, and digital infrastructure"}. Estimated infrastructure investment: ₹${Math.round((totalPopulation * 12) / 1000)} crores. ${isLargeZone ? "Multi-ward coordination essential for integrated infrastructure development." : "Focused infrastructure planning enables efficient implementation."}`,

    administrative_efficiency: `Administrative coordination across ${wardCount} wards is ${isLargeZone ? "complex requiring unified governance structures and technology-enabled coordination" : "manageable with existing administrative frameworks"}. ${wardCount > 8 ? "Consider establishing joint development authority for streamlined decision-making" : "Standard inter-ward coordination mechanisms should suffice"}. Service delivery efficiency ${averageDensity > 20000 ? "requires optimization through technology and resource pooling" : "can be maintained through conventional approaches with gradual improvements"}.`,

    development_opportunities: `Development potential is ${hasLargeWards ? "excellent with significant land availability" : "good through infill and redevelopment projects"}. Key opportunities include ${hasLargeWards ? "new townships, IT parks, educational institutions, and large-scale recreational facilities" : "mixed-use developments, urban renewal, vertical construction, and community-focused projects"}. ${totalArea > 50 ? "Large area enables comprehensive master planning with phased development" : "Compact area allows for intensive, well-integrated development"}. Market potential supports ${isHighDensity ? "premium developments and commercial hubs" : "diverse housing options and local business centers"}.`,

    challenges: `Primary challenges include ${isLargeZone ? "multi-ward coordination complexity, diverse stakeholder management, and large-scale project oversight" : "optimizing limited space, managing growth pressures, and maintaining service quality"}. ${isHighDensity ? "High density creates traffic congestion, parking shortages, and utility strain requiring immediate attention" : "Moderate density allows for proactive planning to prevent future issues"}. ${wardCount > 5 ? "Administrative coordination across multiple wards may slow decision-making and implementation" : "Fewer wards enable faster consensus and execution"}. Environmental compliance and community engagement require continuous attention throughout development.`,
